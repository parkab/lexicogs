In this game, the player is tasked to find a target word hidden among hundreds of other moving words. The player will have access to filtering tools to narrow down the amount of words on the screen, but these tools appear to the player in a random order to which they must adapt to. A timer will count down once the game starts and the only way the user can recover time is by guessing the correct word. Players will also have limited access to a stopwatch that will slow down the movement of all words and also pause the timer. As more words are guessed correctly, the words move across the screen faster and less time is added when finding the target word. The goal of the player is to guess as many words as possible before time runs out.
